                    “This was an amazing trip! There were so many highlights... our outstanding, kind, patient, amazing leader Gustavo!! What an absolute saint. He was so organized and insightful ! Our awesome trek crew who spoiled us with outstanding food and comraderie. The beautiful people of Peru who are so generous with their history and culture. The hiking was challenging but the views made it totally worth the effort. Honestly I cannot think of a way this trip could have been better. We were so well cared for and it is definitely an active adventure!”

                    “This trip was truly a trip of a lifetime for me. Not only did I see sights about which I had dreamed my whole life, I got to experience everything close up and personal. The Peru segment was fantastic - only vacation I have been on where I came back in better shape than I left - the hikes were glorious and wonderfully challenging. Seeing Machu Picchu was more than I ever expected. The Galapagos are a water and marine life lovers dream. Best snorkeling we have ever done, and the different islands were all so unique. I don't have enough good things to say about this tour. Well organized, educational and most of all, fun! We don't usually take tours, but this one made us feel like we hit the jackpot. Excellent!”

                    “We travel....a lot, and this was an epic adventure! What we saw was amazing but even more impressive was the logistics behind our travel. Our trip was flawless. All the transportation and local guides were on time and extremely nice. Our main guides, Sergio and Tambo were very special people. Wonderfully knowledgeable and went out of their way to make our trip special. I will highly recommend Active Adventure to everyone.”

                    “As a traveler, I rely on a trusted company that can get me safely from point A to B, especially when I’m unfamiliar with the area. At the same time, I expect them to provide excellent customer service (addressing questions/concerns, employing outgoing/knowledgeable guides, etc.). After my third trip with Active Adventures, I feel safe to assume that they check all of these boxes off for me!”
