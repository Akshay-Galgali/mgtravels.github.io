            <h2>TAMIL NADU PACKAGE</h2>
<h3>Rs. 14,299</h3>
<h3>6 DAYS & 7 NIGHTS</h3>
         <p>

<p>Welcome to Tamil Nadu</p>
<p>

<strong>DAY 01:</strong>
One week is an ideal amount of time to immerse yourself in the diversity of Delhi, India's capital city. There's plenty to see and do, and you certainly won't be idle!

Incongruous Old Delhi and New Delhi make up the two distinct parts of the city. Old Delhi was once the exalted 17th century walled city of Shahjahanabad, built and occupied by indomitable Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. These days it's unbelievably crowded and crumbling but undeniably has the most astonishing sights in the city. The British formed and constructed New Delhi when they transferred their capital there from Kolkata in 1911. This neat and well-planned area is dominated by wide, tree-lined roads and dignified government buildings.

Although out of the way, the upscale residential district of south Delhi is also worth visiting for its markets and trendy neighborhoods. It has some significant monuments and lovely bed and breakfasts too.

This itinerary for one week in Delhi focuses on one area of the city at a time, to minimize the amount of driving in a day. This is important, as the city becomes congested with heavy traffic in the mornings from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., and evenings from 5.30 p.m. to 7 p.m.

Delhi has a great Metro train system. However, for comfort and convenience, you may wish to hire a car and driver to get around. Your driver will take care of you, and you'll be harassed much less as well.

Let's get started!
</p><p>

<strong>DAY 02:</strong>
Gurudwara Bangla Sahib

The itinerary for Monday has been designed keeping in mind that many monuments, museums and markets in Delhi are closed on this day — including the Red Fort, Akshardham Temple, Bahai Lotus Temple, and Gandhi Smriti. Never mind though, because there are plenty of interesting things to see and do around Connaught Place, New Delhi's vibrant commercial center.

8:30 a.m.: Start the day at Agrasen ki Baoli step well (Hailey Road, off K G Marg. Open daily, sunrise to sunset. Free entry.) flanked by high-rise buildings near Connaught Place. It's thought to have been constructed by King Agrasen during the ancient Mahabharata period, and later rebuilt in the 14th century by the entrepreneurial Agrawal community. Now devoid of water, you can descend the 100-plus stairs into its depths. The step well has been featured in two Bollywood movies — PK, and more recently Sultan.

</p><p>

<strong>DAY 03:</strong>


 Shraddha Gosavi / TripSavvy
Throw yourself into experiencing intoxicating Old Delhi today. It will most likely overwhelm your senses, so it's best to take a guided walking tour. You'll definitely get to see more than what you would by trying to navigate it yourself.

9 a.m.: Skip your hotel breakfast and join this half-day Old Delhi Bazaar Walk and Haveli Visit, offered by Masterji ki Haveli (cost: $50 per person). As well meandering through alleyways and markets (including Asia's largest spice market), you'll be able to sample some street foods. The tour ends at one of the few remaining old havelis (a private mansion where a single family has lived for generations) for a delicious home-cooked lunch with the owners. It's enlightening and informative, and you'll get rare insight into everyday life in Old Delhi.

</p><p>

<strong>DAY 04:</strong>
Swaminarayan Akshardham
 Shraddha Gosavi / TripSavvy
Morning: Visit Sanjay Colony slum in the south of Delhi with Reality Tours and Travel (cost 750-850 rupees per person). This is not poverty tourism like you may expect. Rather, it's an opportunity to dispel preconceived notions, and learn how the community thrives despite obvious challenges. You'll see small scale industry, places of worship, and residential quarters. Plus, there's the option to have a vegetarian lunch with a local family in their home. Expect to sit on the floor and eat with your hand, Indian style! Eighty percent of tour profits are invested in helping the community.


</p><p>

<strong>DAY 05:</strong>

Time lapse of someone walking through the Bada Gumbad complex in Lodhi Gardens
Shraddha Gosavi / TripSavvy
7 a.m.: Join fit Delhi locals on an invigorating early morning walk in Lodhi Gardens (Lodhi Road, New Delhi). This sprawling 90 acre city park is home to a number of monuments, including tombs of 15th and 16th century rulers. The gardens were built around them by the British in 1936. (Entry fee: Free for all).

8:30 a.m.: Tuck into a hearty breakfast at The All American Diner inside the India Habitat Center (opposite Lodhi Gardens on Lodhi Road). You'll feel like you've been transported back in time to the 1960s! Waffles, milkshakes, pancakes, cereal, oatmeal, pastries, eggs, bacon and sausages are all on the menu.

</p><p>

<strong>DAY 06:</strong>

looking up at the Qutab Minar
Shraddha Gosavi / TripSavvy 
8 a.m.: Start the day at Qutab Minar (Mehrauli, South Delhi. Open daily from sunrise to sunset). This UNESCO World Heritage site was built in 1206 and is the tallest brick minaret in the world. It's an incredible example of early Indo–Islamic architecture, with a mysterious history. (Entry fee: 500 rupees for foreigners and 30 rupees for Indians. Free for children under 15 years old).

9 a.m.: Next to Qutab Minar, lesser-known Mehrauli Archaeological Park is spread over 200 acres. It contains more than 100 historically significant monuments and each has a unique story to tell. Two highlights are the 16th century Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb, with its alluring architecture, and the ancient step well Rajon Ki Baoli. (Entry fee: Free for all).
